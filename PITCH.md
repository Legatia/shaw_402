# Shaw 402 - Pitch Deck

> **Tagline:** The Future of Affiliate Commerce is Decentralized

---

## 🎯 The Problem

### Affiliate Marketing is Broken

**For Merchants:**
- 💸 High platform fees (15-30% to Shopify, ShareASale, CJ Affiliate)
- ⏰ Delayed payouts (30-90 day waiting periods)
- 🔒 Platform lock-in with no data ownership
- 💰 Monthly subscriptions ($99-$299/month)
- 🤝 No control over commission structures

**For Affiliates:**
- 🐌 Commission delays (sometimes 60+ days)
- 📉 Opaque tracking and reporting
- 💔 Trust issues with centralized platforms
- 🚫 Platform can freeze accounts or withhold payments
- 💸 High withdrawal fees

**The Market:**
- $17 billion affiliate marketing industry (2023)
- Growing 10% annually
- 80% of brands use affiliate programs
- But... current solutions are stuck in Web2

---

## 💡 The Solution: Shaw 402

**A decentralized affiliate commerce platform powered by Solana**

### Core Value Proposition

**Instant. Transparent. Autonomous.**

Shaw 402 uses blockchain technology to eliminate intermediaries and automate commission payments:

✅ **Automatic Commission Splits** - USDC paid instantly on-chain
✅ **Zero Trust Required** - Cryptographic payment authorization via x402 protocol
✅ **Autonomous Payment Agents** - Each merchant gets a dedicated processor
✅ **One-Time Fee** - 1 SOL registration, no monthly subscriptions
✅ **Earn While You Hold** - Vault system with 3-11.5% APY on deposits

---

## 🏗️ How It Works

### 1. Merchant Registration (30 seconds)
```
Deposit 1 SOL (Refundable) → Get Payment Agent → Start Recruiting Affiliates
```
*Note: Your 1 SOL deposit is fully refundable when you cancel service*

### 2. Payment Flow (Fully Automated)
```
Customer Pays 100 USDC
    ↓
Agent Detects Payment
    ↓
Facilitator Verifies & Splits
    ↓
┌─────────┬──────────────┬───────────┐
│ Platform│   Affiliate  │  Merchant │
│   5%    │     15%      │    80%    │
│  5 USDC │   15 USDC    │  80 USDC  │
└─────────┴──────────────┴───────────┘
Instant Settlement (< 5 seconds)
```

### 3. Vault Deposits (Optional)
```
Lock SOL/USDC → Earn Dynamic APY → Unlock After Period
```

**Lock Periods & Max APY:**
- 6 months → 5% APY
- 1 year → 6.5% APY
- 3 years → 9% APY
- 5 years → 11.5% APY

**Dynamic Yield Formula:**
```
APY = Base (3%) + Volume Bonus (0-3.5%) + Profit Share (0-5%)
```

---

## 🚀 Technology Stack

### **x402 Protocol**
Cryptographic payment authorization for settlement services:
- Prevents replay attacks via nonce system
- Atomic multi-party settlements
- Zero-trust architecture

### **Solana Blockchain**
- ⚡ 400ms block times (instant confirmations)
- 💰 ~$0.00025 transaction costs
- 📈 65,000 TPS capacity

### **Smart Contracts (Anchor)**
- 🔒 On-chain vault with lock periods
- 📊 Performance-based APY calculation
- 🤖 Agent authorization system
- 💎 Merchant tier tracking (Bronze → Platinum)

### **Autonomous Agents**
- 🤖 Each merchant gets a dedicated payment processor
- 👁️ Monitors agent wallet for incoming payments
- ✅ Auto-creates x402 authorizations
- 🔄 Triggers facilitator settlements

---

## 💰 Business Model

### Revenue Streams

**1. Security Deposits (Asset Base)**
- 1 SOL per merchant (refundable, not revenue)
- Holds deposits in treasury
- Can stake deposits to earn yield
- Refunded when merchant cancels

**2. Platform Commission**
- 5% of every transaction
- Paid automatically in USDC
- Scales with merchant volume

**3. Deposit Staking Revenue (Active)**
- Stake merchant security deposits via Marinade/Jito
- Earn 5-8% APY on staked SOL
- 100% platform revenue (deposits are our working capital)
- Example: 1,000 merchants × 1 SOL × 6% APY = 60 SOL/year

**4. Vault Deposits (Merchant-Owned)**
- Merchants voluntarily lock additional capital
- Earn dynamic APY (3-11.5%)
- Share 80% rewards with merchants, keep 20%

### Market Projections

**Year 1 (Conservative)**
```
Revenue Breakdown:
- Transaction fees: 100 merchants × $10,000/month × 5% = $50K/month = $600K/year
- Deposit staking: 100 SOL × 6% APY × $150 = $900/year
- Total Year 1: ~$601K

Additional:
- 100 SOL held as refundable deposits (working capital, not revenue)
- Can be used as liquidity buffer or staking collateral
```

**Year 3 (Growth)**
```
Revenue Breakdown:
- Transaction fees: 5,000 merchants × $20,000/month × 5% = $5M/month = $60M/year
- Deposit staking: 5,000 SOL × 6% APY × $150 = $45K/year
- Vault staking spread: 20% of merchant vault rewards ≈ $500K/year
- Premium features: $1M/year

Total Year 3: ~$61.5M

Additional:
- 5,000 SOL held as deposits (~$750K working capital)
- Potential merchant vault TVL: $5-10M
```
